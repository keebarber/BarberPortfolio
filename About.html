<!--About me -->

<div class="container-fluid aboutMe">
        <div class="center-text" id="center-stuff">
            <p><span id="big-letter">M</span><span id="first-line">y name is Keenan</span> and I enjoy spending my weekdays in front of the screen creating code and my weekends in nature creating experiences.</p>
            <p>I have a passion for efficiency in design through simplicity. </p>
            <p>I have a newfound love in programming and spend my time learning new ways to acheive the results I desire.</p>
            <p>After school I spent the better part of 2 years in Colorado, where I worked at a homeless shelter, learning how to interact well with people of all tyoes. I spent many a weekend deep in the Rockies, camping and hiking to find every majestic vista I could.</p>
            <p>I moved back to Michigan in 2016 and have been working for Farmers Insurance as a claims adjuster, where I use my problem-solving to help people in some of the worst time of their life.</p>
            <p>I have always enjoyed the challenges that come through math and have a B.S. in Statistics as a result. However, I searched for a way to balance my love for problem-solving with a creative outlet.</p>
            <p>At long last, I discovered web development and fell head over heels for the chance to overcome challenges while creating something of my own design.</p>
            <p>I progressed rapidly through HTML and CSS web courses online and quickly moved into the Bootstrap framework to streamline my processes.</p>
            <p>My time as of late has been spent learning the power of Javascript and jQuery and experimenting with the ways it allows my sites to remain dynamic and clutter-free.</p>

            <p>When not coding, I spend as much time as I can outside with the people in my life who seek adventure and a chance to get away from the weekday life.</p>
            <p>Photography is my excuse to get outside and visit new places and try and capture the world.</p>
            <p>I primarily document my trips but have had some work doing engagement and family sessions for anyone who reaches out to me. My adventures find their way to instagram and 500px and I keep most of my portfolio on my SmugMug.</p>
            <p>I currently live in Grand Rapids, MI, where I work while looking for a full-time web development position where I can make my passion my career.</p>
            <p>If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me at <a href="#" id='email'>keenan.c.barber@gmail.com</a> or view my resume.</p>
