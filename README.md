Personal Website/Grand Circus Application
https://keebarber.github.io/BarberPortfolio/

First attempt at building a personal website, ultimately to showcase my photography and web development projects as I continue to learn.
Was submitted in late summer 2017 as part of the application process for the Grand Rapids' Grand Circus Front End Bootcamp.
Current status is on hold while I continue with the bootcamp and focusing on maintaining performance there.
